## 🎯 Technical Innovations (ALL CORRECTED)

### 1. **Proper 6-Phase Goal Flow**
```python
def get_goal_for_actor(self, state):
    # Step 1: Get placement options from state model
    placement_options = self.state_model.get_top5_placement_options(state)
    
    # Step 2 & 3: Q-learning evaluation + epsilon-greedy selection
    goal = self.goal_selector.select_goal(placement_options, self.q_learning, state)
    
    return goal  # Properly evaluated 36D goal vector
```

### 2. **Multi-Step Bootstrapping**
```python
def compute_n_step_returns(self, experiences):
    for i in range(len(experiences) - self.n_step + 1):
        n_step_return = 0
        gamma_power = 1
        
        for j in range(self.n_step):  # 4-step returns
            n_step_return += gamma_power * experiences[i + j]['reward']
            gamma_power *= self.gamma
            if experiences[i + j]['done']: break
```

### 3. **210D State Vector Conversion**
```python
def obs_to_state_vector(self, obs):
    # CORRECTED: Remove empty_grid
    current_piece_grid = obs['current_piece_grid'].flatten()  # 200
    next_piece = obs['next_piece']  # 7
    metadata = [obs['current_rotation'], obs['current_x'], obs['current_y']]  # 3
    
    return np.concatenate([current_piece_grid, next_piece, metadata])  # 210D
```

### 4. **Episode Management**
```python
def structure_exploration_as_episodes(self, exploration_data):
    episodes = []
    for data in exploration_data:
        if self._should_end_episode(data):  # Game over or strategic stopping
            episodes.append(current_episode)
    
    # Limit to top episodes by reward to prevent explosion
    episodes.sort(key=lambda x: x['total_reward'], reverse=True)
    return episodes[:self.max_episodes_per_batch]
```

### 5. **Goal Validation with Penalties**
```python
def _validate_placement(self, rotation, x_pos, y_pos):
    if not (0 <= rotation <= 3 and 0 <= x_pos <= 9 and 0 <= y_pos <= 19):
        return False
    # TODO: Add piece shape validation
    return True

# In training: validity_penalty += 10.0 if not valid
```
