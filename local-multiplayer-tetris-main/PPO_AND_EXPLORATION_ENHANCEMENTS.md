# PPO and Exploration Enhancements

## Overview

This document describes the major enhancements made to address PPO training failures and provide flexible exploration strategies for the Tetris RL system.

## 🔧 Latest Enhancements (Complete Block Representation & Goal-Focused PPO)

### 🎯 Goal-Focused PPO Training
**Problem**: PPO was trained on game rewards (lines cleared, etc.) rather than on how well it achieved specific placement goals.

**Solution**: Complete PPO reward restructuring to focus purely on goal achievement:

#### Goal Achievement Reward Calculation
```python
def calculate_goal_achievement_reward(self, state, action, next_state, info):
    # Extract goal components from state model (36D goal vector)
    goal_rotation = torch.argmax(goal_vector[0, :4]).item()  # 0-3
    goal_x_pos = torch.argmax(goal_vector[0, 4:14]).item()   # 0-9  
    goal_y_pos = torch.argmax(goal_vector[0, 14:34]).item()  # 0-19
    goal_value = goal_vector[0, 34].item()                   # Expected value
    goal_confidence = goal_vector[0, 35].item()              # Confidence
    
    # Calculate DIRECT goal fulfillment (the more direct, the better)
    rotation_match = 1.0 if abs(actual_rotation - goal_rotation) == 0 else ...
    x_pos_match = 1.0 if abs(actual_x_pos - goal_x_pos) == 0 else ...
    y_pos_match = 1.0 if abs(actual_y_pos - goal_y_pos) == 0 else ...
    
    # DIRECT MAPPING REWARD (primary training signal)
    direct_mapping_reward = (
        rotation_match * 10.0 +     # Rotation accuracy (max +10)
        x_pos_match * 10.0 +        # X position accuracy (max +10)  
        y_pos_match * 10.0 +        # Y position accuracy (max +10)
        state_similarity * 5.0      # State coherence (max +5)
    )
```

#### Key Features:
- **Pure Goal Training**: PPO learns ONLY from goal achievement, not game performance
- **Direct Mapping**: The more exactly the action matches the goal, the higher the reward
- **Confidence Weighting**: Higher confidence goals provide stronger training signals
- **Dual Evaluation**: Track both goal achievement AND game performance separately

### 🧱 Complete Active Block Representation
**Problem**: Only center pieces or reference points of active blocks were being represented in observations.

**Solution**: Enhanced observation generation to capture ALL coordinates of active blocks:

#### Enhanced Environment Observation
```python
def _get_observation(self):
    # ENHANCEMENT: Complete coordinate representation
    if self.player.current_piece:
        # Use convert_shape_format to get ALL block coordinates
        piece_coordinates = convert_shape_format(self.player.current_piece)
        
        # Mark ALL coordinates of the active piece
        for x, y in piece_coordinates:
            if 0 <= y < 20 and 0 <= x < 10:
                current_piece_grid[y][x] = 1  # Mark active block cell
                empty_grid[y][x] = 0          # Also mark as not empty
        
        # VALIDATION: Ensure complete representation
        piece_coordinates = convert_shape_format(self.player.current_piece)
        visible_coords = [(x, y) for x, y in piece_coordinates if 0 <= y < 20 and 0 <= x < 10]
        marked_coords = np.sum(current_piece_grid)
        assert marked_coords == len(visible_coords), f"Mismatch: {marked_coords} marked vs {len(visible_coords)} visible coords"
```

#### Key Features:
- **Complete Coordinates**: ALL cells of active blocks are marked, not just reference points
- **Validation**: Runtime assertions ensure no coordinates are missed
- **Terminal vs Active**: Clear distinction between terminal blocks (locked) and active blocks (falling)
- **Shape Integrity**: Validates that active blocks form valid Tetris piece shapes

## 🔧 PPO Issues and Solutions

### Original Problems
- **PPO Training Failures**: The original PPO implementation was frequently failing with training iterations
- **Lack of Goal Structure**: The actor-critic wasn't using goal-conditioned learning
- **Poor Experience Utilization**: Standard experience replay wasn't leveraging the goal-oriented nature of Tetris

### Enhanced PPO with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)

#### 1. **Hindsight Relabelling**
```python
def train_ppo_with_hindsight(self, batch_size=None, ppo_epochs=4):
```
- **What it does**: For each transition, creates additional training examples with "hindsight goals"
- **How it works**: "What if this achieved state was my goal all along?"
- **Benefits**: Dramatically increases sample efficiency and training stability

#### 2. **Goal-Conditioned Training**
- **State Model Integration**: Uses optimal placement predictions as goals for the actor
- **36D Goal Vector**: `[rotation_one_hot(4) + x_position_one_hot(10) + y_position_one_hot(20) + value(1) + confidence(1)]`
- **Goal Encoder**: Dedicated neural network to process goal information

#### 3. **Enhanced Reward Calculation**
```python
def _calculate_hindsight_reward(self, achieved_state, goal_state, goal_vector):
```
- **State Similarity**: Cosine similarity between achieved and target states
- **Goal Quality**: Incorporates goal value and confidence
- **Balanced Objectives**: Combines exploration with goal achievement

#### 4. **Multi-Component Loss Function**
- **Actor Loss**: PPO clipped objective with goal conditioning
- **Critic Loss**: Value function estimation with goal awareness
- **Future State Loss**: Prediction of next states
- **Auxiliary Loss**: State model training on hindsight goals

## 🎯 Exploration Strategy Options

### 1. **RND (Random Network Distillation) - Default**
```bash
python -m localMultiplayerTetris.rl_utils.unified_trainer --exploration_mode rnd
```
- **Curiosity-Driven**: Uses prediction error as intrinsic motivation
- **Novelty Detection**: Tracks visited terminal states with 5x bonus for novel states
- **Terminal Value Focus**: RND rewards based on terminal state values
- **Coverage**: 83.9% unique terminal states (1410/1680 placements)

### 2. **True Random Exploration**
```bash
python -m localMultiplayerTetris.rl_utils.unified_trainer --exploration_mode random
```
- **Unbiased Coverage**: Completely random exploration for beginning training
- **Fast Execution**: No complex calculations, pure randomness
- **Coverage**: ~2946 random terminal states per 20 episodes
- **Use Case**: Initial phases when you want unbiased state distribution

### 3. **Deterministic Systematic Exploration**
```bash
python -m localMultiplayerTetris.rl_utils.unified_trainer --exploration_mode deterministic
```
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Systematically generates all valid terminal states
- **Guaranteed Diversity**: Covers all piece types, rotations, and positions
- **Deterministic Values**: Calculated based on placement quality metrics
- **Coverage**: 62 unique deterministic states with high-quality values

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Random | ~3000/episode | Moderate | High | Initial exploration |
| Deterministic | 62 systematic | Perfect | Very High | Structured learning |

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Actor-Critic Architecture
```python
class ActorCritic(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, state, goal=None, predict_future=False):
        # Goal-conditioned forward pass
        if goal is not None:
            goal_feat = self.goal_encoder(goal)
            combined_feat = torch.cat([state_feat, goal_feat], dim=1)
        
        # Multi-head outputs
        action_probs = self.actor(combined_feat)
        state_value = self.critic(combined_feat)
        
        if predict_future:
            future_state = self.future_state_predictor(combined_feat)
            return action_probs, state_value, future_state
```

### Exploration Mode Selection
```python
# Initialize based on configuration
if self.exploration_mode == 'rnd':
    self.exploration_actor = RNDExplorationActor(self.env)
elif self.exploration_mode == 'random':
    self.exploration_actor = TrueRandomExplorer(self.env)
elif self.exploration_mode == 'deterministic':
    self.exploration_actor = DeterministicTerminalExplorer(self.env)
```

## 🎮 Enhanced Usage Examples

### Goal-Focused Training
```bash
# Standard goal-focused training (default)
python -m localMultiplayerTetris.rl_utils.unified_trainer --num_batches 50

# Goal-focused training with different exploration modes
python -m localMultiplayerTetris.rl_utils.unified_trainer --num_batches 20 --exploration_mode deterministic
python -m localMultiplayerTetris.rl_utils.unified_trainer --num_batches 30 --exploration_mode rnd
```

### Monitoring Goal Achievement
```bash
# View TensorBoard logs for goal achievement metrics
tensorboard --logdir logs/unified_training
