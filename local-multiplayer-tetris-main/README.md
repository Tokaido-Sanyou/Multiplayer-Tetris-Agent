- Next Piece: 7 values (one-hot encoding for next piece)
- Metadata: 3 values (current_rotation, current_x, current_y)
Total: 410 dimensions
```

### Action Representation (8-dimensional one-hot)
Actions are encoded as binary vectors:
```
[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] = Move Left
[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] = Move Right  
[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0] = Move Down
[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] = Rotate Clockwise
[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0] = Rotate Counter-clockwise
[0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0] = Hard Drop
[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0] = Hold Piece
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] = No-op
```

### Goal Vector (36-dimensional)
State model outputs optimal placements as goal vectors:
```
- Rotation One-Hot: 4 values (rotation 0-3)
- X Position One-Hot: 10 values (x coordinate 0-9)
- Y Position One-Hot: 20 values (y coordinate 0-19, landing position)

```

## üîÑ Training Algorithms

### üåü NEW: Staged Unified Training Algorithm
**Purpose**: To address the "moving target" problem where the actor tries to learn from a state model that is also rapidly changing. This staged approach first stabilizes the state model, then trains the actor on these stable goals, and finally fine-tunes both.

**3-Stage Schedule** (configurable, e.g., 300 batches total):
1.  **Stage 1: State Model Pretraining** (e.g., Batches 0-149)
    *   **Focus**: Intensively train the `StateModel`.
    *   `ActorCritic` training is **disabled**.
    *   **Goal**: Learn optimal placements, line clearing strategies, and produce stable, high-quality goal vectors.
    *   *Intensity*: State model may undergo multiple training epochs per batch.
    *   *Evaluation*: At the end of this stage, the quality of the state model's goals (consistency, optimality, diversity) is evaluated.

2.  **Stage 2: Actor Training with Frozen Goals** (e.g., Batches 150-249)
    *   **Focus**: Intensively train the `ActorCritic` agent.
    *   `StateModel` parameters are **frozen**.
    *   **Goal**: Actor learns to achieve the stable, high-quality goals provided by the pretrained state model. Gradients from the actor **do not** flow back to the state model (`goal_vector.detach()` is used).
    *   *Intensity*: Actor (PPO) may undergo multiple training epochs per batch.

3.  **Stage 3: Joint Fine-tuning** (e.g., Batches 250-299)
    *   **Focus**: Fine-tune both the `StateModel` and `ActorCritic` agent.
    *   Both models are trained, and gradients are allowed to flow through the goals.
    *   **Goal**: Achieve optimal alignment and performance by allowing both models to adapt to each other.

**Benefits**:
-   **Stable Learning**: Reduces oscillations and instability caused by the actor chasing a moving target (the state model).
-   **Improved Goal Quality**: Ensures the state model produces meaningful and reliable goals before the actor starts learning from them.
-   **Better Actor Performance**: The actor can learn more effectively when guided by consistent and sensible goals.

### üåô 8-Phase Dream-Enhanced Training Algorithm

**Revolutionary training system with explicit goal achievement through synthetic dreams:**

#### Phase 1: Enhanced Terminal Value-Based RND Exploration
- Same as standard training: **Enhanced RND Exploration Actor** for curiosity-driven exploration

- Trains state model on terminal placement data to generate placement goals
- Outputs confidence scores for placement quality estimation

#### Phase 3: Future Reward Prediction

- Generates 30+ dream episodes per batch with 15-20 steps each
- Tracks dream quality scores (0-1) based on goal achievement success

#### **Phase 5: üåâ DREAM-REALITY TRANSFER (NEW)**
- **Dream-Reality Bridge** transfers dream knowledge to real actor execution
- Knowledge distillation: Actor learns to mimic goal matcher's optimal actions
- 150+ transfer steps per batch with gradient clipping for stability
- Validates dream quality (>0.6 threshold) before transfer

#### **Phase 6: üéÆ DREAM-GUIDED EXPLOITATION (ENHANCED)**
- Actor uses **dream guidance** for real environment actions
- Weighted blending: `dream_weight √ó dream_policy + (1-dream_weight) √ó actor_policy`
- **Dream weaning**: Gradually reduce dream dependence from 1.0 to 0.1 over training
- Multi-attempt mechanism with hindsight experience replay for enhanced learning

#### Phase 7: Dream-Enhanced PPO Training
- Standard PPO training but with dream-enhanced actor network
- Actor has learned explicit goal achievement from dream practice

#### Phase 8: Dual Evaluation (Goal + Game Performance)
- Evaluates both goal achievement rate and traditional game performance
- Tracks alignment between goal-focused learning and actual game success

**Expected Results**: Goal success rate improvement from 8.8% ‚Üí 60-80%

### üéØ 6-Phase Standard Hierarchical Training Algorithm

#### Phase 1: Enhanced Terminal Value-Based RND Exploration
- **Enhanced RND Exploration Actor** uses terminal value prediction for curiosity-driven exploration
- **Terminal Value Focus**: RND rewards based on terminal state values rather than prediction error
- **Piece-Focused Episodes**: Each episode explores one specific piece type (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) for consistent learning
- **Episode Distribution**: Automatically adjusts episode count to multiples of 7 for even piece coverage
- **Novelty Detection**: Tracks visited terminal states and strongly encourages exploration of unvisited ones
- **Smart Terminal Generation**: 4-10 terminal placement attempts per step, scaled by intrinsic reward
- Records **ONLY terminal states** with enhanced rewards: terminal_value + intrinsic_bonus + novelty_bonus
- **Unvisited State Bias**: Novel terminal states receive 5x bonus, revisited states get minimal reward
- **Distinct State Tracking**: Reports new terminal states discovered per batch for progress monitoring
- Collects (state, placement, enhanced_terminal_reward, resulting_state, novelty_score, target_piece_type) tuples

#### Phase 2: State Model Learning
- Trains state model on terminal placement data with intrinsic motivation
- Learns to predict optimal rotations and positions
- Uses terminal rewards + intrinsic rewards to weight training importance

- Focuses on terminal state value estimation with RND-enhanced data

#### Phase 4: Goal-Conditioned Exploitation Episodes  
- **Goal-Conditioned Policy Rollouts** with adaptive piece presence rewards
- State model generates optimal placement goals
- Actor-critic uses goals for action selection
- **Piece Presence Rewards**: Start at 1.0 per piece, decay to 0.0 over first 500 episodes
- Tracks lines cleared, rewards, and episode length
- Collects experience for policy improvement

#### Phase 5: PPO Training
- Trains actor-critic with PPO clipping using enhanced rewards
- Incorporates auxiliary state model loss
- Updates both policy and value functions
- Uses prioritized experience replay with RND-enhanced data

#### Phase 6: Evaluation
- Pure exploitation episodes (Œµ = 0) with piece presence rewards
- Measures policy performance with adaptive reward system
- Tracks improvement over training with RND statistics

```

### Training Schedule
```python
class TrainingConfig:
    NUM_BATCHES = 100                    # More batches
    EXPLORATION_EPISODES = 30            # More exploration
    PPO_EPOCHS = 6                       # More PPO updates
    MAX_EPISODE_STEPS = 3000             # Longer episodes
```

## üß™ Experimental Features

**üéÆ Ready to train your own Tetris AI? Start with the unified trainer and watch your agent learn to master the game through hierarchical reinforcement learning!** 

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Standard Unified Training
```bash
python -m localMultiplayerTetris.rl_utils.unified_trainer --num_batches 50 --exploration_mode rnd --visualize
```
-   `--num_batches`: Total number of training batches (e.g., 50 batches * 20 exploration + 20 exploitation episodes = 2000 total episodes by default).
-   `--exploration_mode`: `rnd` (default), `random`, or `deterministic`.
-   `--visualize`: Add this flag to see the Tetris game rendered for the last exploitation episode of each batch.
-   `--log_dir`: Specify log directory (default: `logs/unified_training`).
-   `--checkpoint_dir`: Specify checkpoint directory (default: `checkpoints/unified`).

### 2. üåü NEW: Staged Unified Training (Recommended for Improved Stability)
```bash
python -m localMultiplayerTetris.rl_utils.staged_unified_trainer --num_batches 300 --exploration_mode rnd
```
-   `--num_batches`: Total number of training batches across all stages (e.g., 300). The script internally divides these into pretraining, actor training, and joint fine-tuning.
-   `--exploration_mode`: `rnd` (default), `random`, or `deterministic`.
-   `--visualize`: Add this flag to see rendering.
-   `--log_dir`: Specify log directory (default: `logs/staged_unified_training`).
-   `--checkpoint_dir`: Specify checkpoint directory (default: `checkpoints/staged_unified`).

### 3. Dream-Enhanced Training
```bash
python -m localMultiplayerTetris.rl_utils.unified_trainer_dream --num_batches 100 --exploration_mode rnd --visualize
```
-   Uses the `unified_trainer_dream.py` script. Parameters are similar to standard training.

### üí° Configuration
// ... existing code ...
### üìà Monitoring Training
-   **TensorBoard**: Comprehensive logs are saved in the specified `log_dir`.
    ```bash
    tensorboard --logdir logs/staged_unified_training
    # or logs/unified_training, logs/dream_enhanced_training
    ```
-   **Console Output**: Detailed batch summaries and phase-specific results are printed.
-   **Log Files**: `unified_training.log`, `staged_unified_training.log`, or `dream_training.log` capture all console output.
