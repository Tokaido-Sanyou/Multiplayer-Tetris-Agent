# Tetris RL System - Fixes and Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the debugging fixes, architectural changes, and improvements made to the Tetris RL system to address inconsistencies, implement one-hot action encoding, and create a comprehensive configuration system.

## 1. Debugging Fixes

### 1.1 GPU Device Mismatch Error
**Issue**: Runtime error due to tensors being on different devices (CUDA vs CPU)
**Location**: `state_model.py` - `train_from_placements` method
**Fix**: Added automatic device detection and tensor movement to ensure all tensors are on the same device as the model
```python
# Get device from model parameters
device = next(self.parameters()).device
# Move all tensors to device
state = torch.FloatTensor(data['state']).unsqueeze(0).to(device)
rot_loss = criterion(rot_logits, torch.LongTensor([rotation]).to(device))
```

### 1.2 Action Space Inconsistency  
**Issue**: Exploration actor used action range 0-6 but environment defines 0-7
**Location**: `exploration_actor.py`
**Fix**: Updated random action generation to use full range 0-7

### 1.3 Observation Space Extension
**Issue**: Environment only provided basic observation but neural networks expected 206-dimensional state
**Location**: `tetris_env.py`
**Fix**: Extended observation space to include current piece metadata (shape, rotation, x, y)

## 2. Action Representation Change: Scalar to One-Hot

### 2.1 Motivation
Changed from scalar action representation (0-7) to one-hot encoding (8-dimensional binary vectors) for:
- Better neural network training dynamics
- Explicit action representation
- Improved interpretability

### 2.2 Action Mapping
```
Scalar → One-Hot Vector
0 (Move Left)     → [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
1 (Move Right)    → [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
2 (Move Down)     → [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]
3 (Rotate CW)     → [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]
4 (Rotate CCW)    → [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]
5 (Hard Drop)     → [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]
6 (Hold Piece)    → [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]
7 (No-op)         → [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]
```

### 2.3 Files Modified for One-Hot Actions

#### Environment (`tetris_env.py`)
- Changed action space from `Discrete(8)` to `Box(low=0, high=1, shape=(8,), dtype=np.int8)`
- Updated step method to convert one-hot to scalar for internal processing
- Added helper methods for action conversion

#### Actor-Critic Network (`actor_critic.py`)
- Changed actor output from softmax to sigmoid for binary decisions
- Updated action selection to return one-hot vectors
- Modified training methods to handle one-hot action storage/retrieval

#### Replay Buffer (`replay_buffer.py`)
- Updated to convert one-hot actions to scalars for efficient storage
- Modified sampling to return scalar actions (converted to one-hot in training)

#### Exploration Actor (`exploration_actor.py`)
- Updated random action generation to produce one-hot vectors

#### Unified Trainer (`unified_trainer.py`)
- Updated exploitation and evaluation phases to handle one-hot actions
