# Tetris RL Agent

A reinforcement learning agent for Tetris using a 6-phase hierarchical training algorithm combining exploration, state modeling, future reward prediction, exploitation, PPO training, and evaluation.

## ✅ System Status

The system is now **fully functional** with the following verified features:
- ✅ **Import consistency**: All modules import correctly 
- ✅ **Multi-channel observations**: 1817-dimensional state space with separate grids for each piece type
- ✅ **8-action space**: One-hot encoded actions (Left, Right, Down, RotateCW, RotateCCW, HardDrop, Hold, DoNothing)
- ✅ **Pure MLP architecture**: No CNN components, fully connected networks
- ✅ **Conditional visualization**: Window only opens during last exploitation episode with `--visualize` flag
- ✅ **GPU acceleration**: CUDA support with automatic device detection
- ✅ **Save/Load system**: Automatic model checkpointing and loading

## Architecture Overview

The system implements a sophisticated 6-phase training pipeline:

1. **Exploration Phase**: Systematic piece placement trials to collect terminal reward data
2. **State Model Training**: Learning optimal placements from exploration data  
3. **Future Reward Prediction**: Training value estimators for long-term planning
4. **Exploitation Phase**: Policy rollouts with experience collection
5. **PPO Training**: Actor-critic optimization with clipping
6. **Evaluation Phase**: Performance assessment without exploration

### Key Components

- **Multi-Channel Observations**: 
  - 7 piece-type grids (7×20×10) with binary occupancy
  - Current piece grid (20×10) 
  - Empty space grid (20×10)
  - Next piece one-hot encoding (7)
  - Hold piece one-hot encoding (7) 
  - Metadata (rotation, x, y positions)
  - **Total: 1817 dimensions**

- **Pure MLP Architecture**:
  - Input: 1817-dimensional state vector
  - Feature extractor: Linear(1817) → Linear(1024) → Linear(512) → Linear(256)
  - Separate actor and critic heads
  - Dropout regularization

- **8-Action Space**: One-hot encoded actions:
  - 0: Move Left
  - 1: Move Right  
  - 2: Soft Drop (Down)
  - 3: Rotate Clockwise
  - 4: Rotate Counter-clockwise
  - 5: Hard Drop
  - 6: Hold Piece
  - 7: Do Nothing

## Quick Start

### Basic Training
```bash
# Train for 50 batches (recommended for testing)
python train.py --num_batches 50

# Train with visualization (shows last episode of each batch)
python train.py --num_batches 50 --visualize

# Full training run
python train.py --num_batches 100
```

### Load and Play Trained Model
```bash
# Play a trained model (checkpoint must exist)
python play_model.py --checkpoint checkpoints/unified/checkpoint_batch_49.pt

# Play with custom settings
python play_model.py --checkpoint checkpoints/unified/checkpoint_batch_49.pt --episodes 5 --step_delay 0.2
```

### Monitor Training Progress
```bash
# View training metrics in real-time
python -c "from tensorboard import main; main.run_main(['--logdir', 'logs/unified_training'])"
```

## Configuration Options

### Training Parameters
- `--num_batches`: Number of training batches (default: 50)
- `--visualize`: Enable visualization for last episode of each batch
- `--log_dir`: Directory for logs (default: logs/unified_training)
- `--checkpoint_dir`: Directory for checkpoints (default: checkpoints/unified)

### Performance Settings
The system automatically detects and uses:
- **CUDA GPU** if available (recommended)
- **Apple Silicon (MPS)** on Mac
- **CPU** as fallback

## Training Phases Detail

Each training batch consists of 6 sequential phases:

### Phase 1: Exploration (50 episodes)
- Systematic exploration of piece placements
- Data collection for state model training
- Builds cache of placement → reward mappings

### Phase 2: State Model Training (5 epochs)
- Learns optimal piece placement policies
- Uses exploration data to train placement selection
- Provides guidance for future exploitation

### Phase 3: Future Reward Prediction (Variable epochs)
- Trains value estimators for long-term planning
- Learns to predict future rewards from state-action pairs
- Enables better decision making in exploitation

### Phase 4: Exploitation (20 episodes)
- Policy rollouts using current actor-critic
- Experience collection for PPO training
- **Visualization only enabled for last episode when `--visualize` flag is used**

### Phase 5: PPO Training (3 iterations)
- Actor-critic policy optimization
- Clipped surrogate objective
- Experience replay from exploitation phase

### Phase 6: Evaluation (10 episodes)
- Pure exploitation without exploration
- Performance assessment of current policy
- Metrics logging for progress tracking

## Output and Monitoring

### Training Logs
- Real-time progress in terminal
- Detailed logs saved to `unified_training.log`
- TensorBoard metrics in `logs/unified_training/`

### Checkpoints
- Automatic saving every 10 batches
- Manual saving with Ctrl+C (graceful shutdown)
- Saved to `checkpoints/unified/checkpoint_batch_X.pt`

### Key Metrics
- Episode rewards and lengths
- Lines cleared per episode  
- PPO training losses (actor, critic, reward prediction)
- Exploration data quality
- GPU utilization and timing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors**: All import issues have been resolved with the automatic import fixer
```bash
python fix_imports.py  # Already run, but available if needed
```

**CUDA Out of Memory**: Reduce batch sizes in TrainingConfig
```python
self.ppo_batch_size = 32  # Reduce from 64
self.batch_size = 16      # Reduce from 32
```

**Poor Performance**: 
- Increase `num_batches` for longer training
- Check TensorBoard logs for training progress
- Verify GPU utilization with `nvidia-smi`

**Visualization Issues**: 
- Ensure pygame is installed: `pip install pygame`
- Use `--visualize` flag only when needed (impacts performance)
- Visualization only shows during last exploitation episode of each batch

## Requirements

```
torch>=1.9.0
numpy>=1.20.0  
pygame>=2.0.0
gym>=0.18.0
tensorboard>=2.8.0
```

## Performance Expectations

- **Training Speed**: ~1-2 minutes per batch on modern GPU
- **Memory Usage**: ~2-4GB GPU memory for full training
- **Convergence**: Typically shows improvement within 20-50 batches
- **Storage**: ~50MB per checkpoint, ~100MB for full training logs
