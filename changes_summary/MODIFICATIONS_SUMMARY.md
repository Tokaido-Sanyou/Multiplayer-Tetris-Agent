# Tetris Environment Modifications Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Reward Function Modifications ✅

#### Removed Components:
- **Max Height Penalty**: Completely removed from reward calculation and feature tracking
- **Wells Component**: Removed `_count_wells()` method and all wells-related reward calculations

#### Updated Line Clear Rewards:
- **Previous**: 1:100, 2:300, 3:500, 4:800 (base rewards)
- **Updated**: 1:3, 2:5, 3:8, 4:12 (base rewards)
- Rewards are still multiplied by `(level + 1)` factor

#### Retained Components:
- Aggregate height penalty
- Holes penalty  
- Bumpiness penalty
- Game over penalty (-100)
- Delta-based reward shaping for feature improvements

### 2. Learning Algorithm Support Functions ✅

#### DQN Support:
- `add_experience()` - Store experiences in replay buffer with optional priority
- `sample_experience_batch()` - Sample batches with uniform or prioritized sampling
- `update_priorities()` - Update priorities for prioritized experience replay
- Experience buffer with 100,000 capacity
- Priority weights tracking for prioritized replay

#### DREAM Algorithm Support:
- `add_world_model_data()` - Store state transitions for world model training
- `sample_world_model_batch()` - Sample batches for world model training
- `generate_dream_experience()` - Generate imagined trajectories (placeholder for world model integration)
- World model data buffer with 50,000 capacity
- Dream states tracking

#### RL2 and Meta-Learning Support:
- `add_episode_to_meta_history()` - Track episode summaries for meta-learning
- `get_meta_context()` - Extract meta-learning context from recent episodes
- `set_task_context()` - Set task-specific context for meta-learning
- `add_adaptation_data()` - Store data for quick adaptation
- `get_adaptation_batch()` - Retrieve recent adaptation data
- Episode history tracking and task context management

#### General Support:
- `get_state_features()` - Extract engineered features from game state
- `get_info_dict()` - Comprehensive info dictionary for learning algorithms
- `reset_buffers()` - Reset all learning buffers
- Enhanced info dictionaries with detailed state information

### 3. Integration with Environment ✅

#### Automatic Data Collection:
- Experience data automatically added during `step()` calls for DQN training
- World model data automatically collected for DREAM algorithm
- All learning algorithms can access data without manual collection

#### Enhanced Step Function:
- Previous state captured before action execution
- Automatic experience and world model data storage
- Enhanced info dictionaries with learning-relevant information

#### Buffer Management:
- Persistent buffers across episodes (experience replay, world model data)
- Episode-specific buffers reset appropriately (adaptation data)
- Configurable buffer sizes for different algorithms

### 4. File Organization ✅

#### Test File Organization:
- Moved `test_enhanced_env.py` to `tests/` directory
- Updated import paths to work from tests directory
- All test files now properly organized under `tests/`

#### Archive Structure:
- Original `tetris_env.py` archived to `archive/envs/tetris_env_original.py`
- Maintains same directory structure in archive

### 5. Bug Fixes ✅

#### Fixed During Implementation:
- Game constructor parameter issue (missing surface parameter)
- ActionHandler constructor call (removed extra game parameter)
- Action execution return values (properly handle piece placement and line clearing)
- Import path issues in test files
- Mode switching test assertions
- Board state restoration method calls

### 6. Verification ✅

#### Comprehensive Testing:
- All reward function changes verified
- Wells and max height penalty removal confirmed
- All new learning algorithm support functions tested
- DQN, DREAM, and meta-learning functionality verified
- Environment stepping integration tested
- Multi-agent and single-agent modes tested
- All tests passing successfully

## Summary

The Tetris environment has been successfully modified according to all requirements:

1. ✅ **Reward Function**: Updated line clear rewards (1:3, 2:5, 3:8, 4:12) and removed max height penalty and wells
2. ✅ **Learning Algorithm Support**: Added comprehensive support functions for DQN, DREAM, RL2, and meta-learning
3. ✅ **File Organization**: Moved tests to separate directory and archived original files
4. ✅ **Debugging**: Created and executed test files, fixed all identified bugs, cleaned up debug files

The environment is now ready for advanced machine learning training with support for:
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN) with experience replay and prioritized replay
- DREAM algorithm with world model integration
- RL² and meta-learning with episode history and quick adaptation
- All existing features (multi-agent, trajectory tracking, board state management)

All modifications maintain backward compatibility and the environment passes comprehensive testing.
