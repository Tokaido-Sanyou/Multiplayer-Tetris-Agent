# Locked Position Controls and DREAM Pipeline Planning

## Overview

This document details the implementation of simplified locked position controls and comprehensive planning for a DREAM (Dreamer) single player pipeline for the multiplayer Tetris game.

## Implementation Date
**December 2024**

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Locked Position Mode Control Simplification
- **Problem**: Complex control scheme with WASD, rotation, and hold controls
- **User Requirement**: Only arrow keys for navigation and space for placement
- **Impact**: Simplified user experience, focused on position selection only

### 2. Action Mode Distinction in Models
- **Problem**: Ensuring all models properly distinguish between movement and locked position selection
- **Verification**: Confirmed DQN models support both action modes via action_space_size parameter
- **Impact**: Proper model adaptation for different action spaces (8 vs 200 actions)

### 3. DREAM Pipeline Planning
- **Problem**: Need comprehensive plan for model-based RL implementation
- **Solution**: Complete architectural design for DREAM single player pipeline
- **Impact**: Foundation for advanced sample-efficient training

## Technical Implementation

### Locked Position Control Fixes

#### 1. Simplified Input Handling
```python
def handle_locked_position_input(event, game, position_cursors):
    """Handle input for locked position mode - only arrow keys and space for navigation/placement"""
    
    # Single player control scheme - only arrow keys for navigation and space for placement
    if event.key == pygame.K_UP:  # Move cursor up
        position_cursors[0]['y'] = max(0, position_cursors[0]['y'] - 1)
    elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:  # Move cursor down
        position_cursors[0]['y'] = min(19, position_cursors[0]['y'] + 1)
    elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:  # Move cursor left
        position_cursors[0]['x'] = max(0, position_cursors[0]['x'] - 1)
    elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:  # Move cursor right
        position_cursors[0]['x'] = min(9, position_cursors[0]['x'] + 1)
    elif event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:  # Place piece at cursor position (hard drop equivalent)
        execute_locked_placement(game.player1, position_cursors[0], game)
```

**Key Changes:**
- Removed WASD controls (W/A/S/D keys)
- Removed rotation controls (Q key)
- Removed hold controls (C key)
- Removed Player 2 controls (multiplayer to single player)
- Simplified to arrow keys + space only

#### 2. Single Player Cursor System
```python
# Before: Two cursors for multiplayer
position_cursors = [{'x': 4, 'y': 19}, {'x': 4, 'y': 19}]

# After: Single cursor for single player
position_cursors = [{'x': 4, 'y': 19}]
```

#### 3. Updated Visual Display
```python
def draw_position_cursors(surface, game, position_cursors):
    """Draw position selection cursor for locked position mode with blinking effect"""
    
    # Blinking effect - alternate visibility every 500ms
    blink_time = int(time.time() * 1000) % 1000
    show_cursor = blink_time < 500
    
    if show_cursor:
        # Single player cursor (green)
        cursor = position_cursors[0]
        cursor_x = grid_start_x + cursor['x'] * cell_size
        cursor_y = grid_start_y + cursor['y'] * cell_size
        
        # Draw green cursor with preview of piece placement
        draw_placement_preview(surface, game.player1, cursor, cursor_x, cursor_y, cell_size, (0, 255, 0))
    
    # Control instructions
    controls_text = font.render("Arrow Keys: Navigate  |  Space: Place", True, (255, 255, 255))
    surface.blit(controls_text, (10, s_height - 60))
```

**Visual Improvements:**
- Single cursor display instead of dual cursors
- Updated control instructions
- Maintained blinking effect (500ms cycle)
- Preserved piece placement preview functionality

### Action Mode Verification

#### DQN Model Support
```python
class DQNModel(TetrisCNN):
    def __init__(self, action_space_size: int = 8, **kwargs):
        # Automatically adapts to action space size
        # Direct mode: action_space_size = 8
        # Locked position mode: action_space_size = 200
```

#### Environment Integration
```python
class TetrisEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self, action_mode: str = 'direct', **kwargs):
        if self.action_mode == 'direct':
            # 8 actions as binary tuple
            single_action_space = spaces.Tuple([spaces.Discrete(2) for _ in range(8)])
        elif self.action_mode == 'locked_position':
            # 200 discrete positions (20x10 grid)
            single_action_space = spaces.Discrete(200)
```

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ DQN models properly handle both action modes
- ✅ Environment correctly distinguishes action modes
- ✅ Configuration system supports mode-specific settings
- ✅ Training scripts accommodate both modes
