3. **Checkpoint System**: Save/resume functionality
4. **Command Line Interface**: Full argument parsing
5. **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA optimization throughout

## üéØ RECOMMENDED USAGE

### For Training
```powershell
# Basic DQN with optimized parameters
python train_redesigned_agent.py --episodes 500 --learning-rate 0.001 --epsilon-start 0.9 --epsilon-end 0.05

# Actor-Locked system
python train_actor_locked_system.py --episodes 200 --actor-trials 10 --show-visualization

# Extended training for better performance
python train_redesigned_agent.py --episodes 1000 --learning-rate 0.001
```

### For Development
```powershell
# Quick system verification
python train_redesigned_agent.py --episodes 10 --device cuda

# Performance testing
python train_redesigned_agent.py --episodes 100 --learning-rate 0.001
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### Performance Warnings
1. **Line Clearing**: Still relatively low (4 in 100 episodes)
2. **Actor Goal Matching**: Low rate (0.009) but functional
3. **Training Efficiency**: May need extended training for optimal results
